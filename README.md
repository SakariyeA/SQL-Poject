#SQL Project Summary: E-Commerce Sales Insights and Optimization
Overview
This project demonstrates the design, management, and querying of a robust relational database for an e-commerce business. It involves creating a normalized database schema, inserting realistic data, optimizing for performance, and deriving actionable business insights through SQL queries and reporting. The project simulates real-world challenges, showcasing the ability to solve practical problems using advanced SQL techniques.

Project Steps
1. Database Schema Design
•	Objective: Create a normalized database to handle e-commerce operations effectively.
•	Steps:
o	Designed a schema with five key tables: Customers, Products, Orders, OrderDetails, and Transactions.
o	Established relationships to ensure data integrity and support analytical queries.
o	Ensured the schema adhered to third normal form (3NF) to reduce redundancy.
2. Data Population
•	Objective: Populate the database with realistic and diverse sample data.
•	Steps:
o	Inserted over 500 customers, 100 products, and 5,000 orders, ensuring realistic data distribution.
o	Handled edge cases like:
	Orders with missing or failed payments.
	Products running out of stock.
o	Used randomization techniques to mimic real-world data scenarios.
3. SQL Queries for Business Insights
•	Objective: Derive actionable insights by addressing practical business scenarios.
•	Query Categories:
o	Sales Trends Analysis:
	Monthly revenue breakdown.
	Top-performing products and categories.
o	Customer Insights:
	Identified loyal customers.
	Found inactive customers over a defined period.
o	Product Management:
	Flagged low-stock products for replenishment.
	Calculated revenue contribution by individual products.
o	Order Analysis:
	Analyzed high-value orders and average order value.
o	Transaction Metrics:
	Measured the percentage of successful transactions.
	Evaluated payment method popularity.
4. Database Optimization
•	Objective: Enhance query performance and scalability.
•	Techniques:
o	Indexing:
	Created indexes on frequently queried columns like CustomerID, ProductID, and OrderDate.
o	Partitioning:
	Partitioned the Orders table by year to improve query efficiency.
o	Query Optimization:
	Analyzed slow queries using EXPLAIN and rewrote complex SQL for better performance.
5. Reporting Layer
•	Objective: Automate business reporting using SQL views and stored procedures.
•	Steps:
o	Built a view to summarize sales by product category.
o	Developed a stored procedure to generate monthly sales reports dynamically.
6. Deliverables
•	Database Schema:
o	ER diagram visualizing relationships between tables.
•	SQL Scripts:
o	Scripts for database creation, data insertion, and querying.
•	Performance Metrics:
o	A report documenting query execution times before and after optimization.
•	Insights Report:
o	A concise summary of key business insights derived from the SQL queries.
